### Solid-Phase

We will now provide the complete theoretical background used within the
tidal models. Admittedly, this section will get quite complicated, but I
will try to formulate things in a clear way! We will start with the
original solid tides model, namely "Lovepy" or as we refer to it
"solid1d". But first let us establish some core concepts.

In gravito-elastic tidal theory the response of a medium is represented
by so called $y$-functions. These functions form a state vector at every
radius $\pmb{y}(r)$. These functions also depend on the $(n,m)$-pair;
$\pmb{y_{n,m}}(r)$. The solid tide modules incorporated into Obliqua
make use of the spheroidal 6--vector solution and the spheroidal
8--vector solution, where the latter is used specifically for the
poro-visco elastic models. Generally the first six $y$-functions are
labeled as follows

$$\pmb{y}_{n,m} = (U_{n,m} , V_{n,m} , X_{n,m} , Y_{n,m}, \Phi_{n,m} , \Psi_{n,m} )^T$$

where the first and second components are the radial and tangential
displacements, the third and fourth components the radial and tangential
stresses, the fifth component the potential and the sixth component the
so called 'potential stress'. By extension, the seventh and eighth
$y$-functions are

$$\pmb{y}_{n,m} = (U_{n,m} , V_{n,m} , X_{n,m} , Y_{n,m}, \Phi_{n,m} , \Psi_{n,m}, P_{n,m}, R_{n,m})^T$$

with $P_{n,m}$ the pore pressure, and $R_{n,m}$ the relative tangential
displacement. Notably, these $y$-functions come in pairs, although this
may not be generally true. We can define two sets, both sets are bounded
from below (e.g. core or internal source), but only one set is bounded
from above (e.g. surface or internal sink). The sets are

$$\text{lower} = U_{n,m} , V_{n,m}, \Phi_{n,m}, P_{n,m}$$ 

and

$$\text{upper} = X_{n,m} , Y_{n,m}, \Psi_{n,m}, R_{n,m}.$$ 

It is worth
noting that there is a direct relation between the lower bound
$y$-functions at the surface and the Lovenumbers 

$$\begin{aligned}
    h_n &= y_1(R) \\
    l_n &= y_2(R) \\
    k_n &= y_5(R) - 1
\end{aligned}$$ 

assuming the $y$-functions are dimensionless (note the
index $i$ in $y_i$ corresponds to the $i$th $y$-function in the state
vector $\pmb{y}_{n,m}$ given above). The relations are identical for the
load Lovenumbers. 

$$\begin{aligned}
    h'_n &= y_1(R) \\
    l'_n &= y_2(R) \\
    k'_n &= y_5(R) - 1
\end{aligned}$$ 

However, in the case of a pressure load (atmosphere),
the relations change slightly 

$$\begin{aligned}
    h^P_n &= y_1(R) \\
    l^P_n &= y_2(R) \\
    k^P_n &= y_5(R)
\end{aligned}$$ 

At the same time the upper $y$-functions at the surface
are subject to the cause specific boundary conditions. For the general
case, if we denote $P$ as an external pressure, $\zeta$ as a surface
mass load, $U$ as an external potential, and $\tau$ as a tangential
component of traction, we can write the general boundary conditions for
a given $n$th degree as 

$$\begin{aligned}
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
 & U & \zeta_n & \tau & P \\ \hline
y_{3}(a) & 0 & -g_e \zeta_n & 0 & -P_n \\
y_{4}(a) & 0 & 0 & \tau_n & 0 \\
y_{6}(a)
           & \dfrac{2n+1}{a} U_n & 4\pi G \zeta_n & 0 & 0
\end{array}
\end{aligned}$$ 

where $g_e$ is the norm of surface gravity. No $y_5$ term appears in the
third row because $y_6$ is already Takeuchi & Saito's (1972) combined
"potential stress" variable: its own radial equation, $dy_6/dr =
(n-1)y_6/r + \ldots$, has no coupling to $y_5$ (unlike the raw
potential-gradient definition used in some other conventions). The
surface mass load can also be written as an external potential $U'$ such
that $\zeta_n = [(2n + 1)/4 \pi G a] U'_n$. 

$$\begin{aligned}
y_{3}(R)   &= - \frac{(2n + 1)g_e}{4 \pi G R} \left[\frac{G}{R} U'_n \right] - P_n \\
y_{4}(R)   &= \tau_n \\
y_{6}(R)   &= \frac{2n+1}{R} \left(U_n + \left[\frac{G}{R} U'_n \right] \right)
\end{aligned}$$ 

Note that `get_surface_bc!` in `src/common.jl` does not literally apply
this $\zeta_n \leftrightarrow U'_n$ conversion; it instead sets
$(U,U',\tau,P)$ directly as dimensionless $0$/$1$ selector flags (see
below), which for the load case numerically works out to $y_3(a) =
-(2n+1)g(a)/(4\pi a^2)$ and $y_6(a) = (2n+1)G/a^2$ — see
[Solid-Phase - solid1d](@ref) for the concrete tidal/load values the
code actually produces.

For now we only use the following: the tidal Love number
corresponding to the case of an external potential perturbation $U$ and
the load Love number computed for a surface mass load perturbation
$\zeta$ or equivalently a potential $U'$. They can be directly
determined setting, respectively $(U, U', \tau, P)$ to $(1,0,0,0)$ for
TLN and $(0,1,0,0)$ for LLN in system. Interestingly, the tidal
potential imposed here $U = 1$ is identical to the tidal potential
$U_{n,m,k}$ listed earlier (up to some normalization factor). We simply
set $U = 1$ here to nondimensionalize the Lovenumbers, and scale the
solution later on with $U_{n,m,k}$.

It should be stated that all of these terms ($U, \zeta_n, \tau, P$) are
non-dimensional here (i.e. 1 if present or 0 if not present). They each
give rise to their own set of Lovenumbers ($h_n , l_n , k_n$), which can
be combined into a distortion potential of the planet through

$$U_n^D = k_n^T + (1+k_n^L)U_n^L + K_n^P U_n^P,$$

where $U_n^L$ and
$U_n^P$ are, respectively, the mass-load and pressure potentials:

$$U_n^L = \frac{3}{2n+1}\frac{g \mathcal{S}_n}{\rho_b}, \qquad U_n^P = \frac{3}{2n+1}\frac{\mathcal{Q_n}}{\rho_b}$$

with surface gravity $g$, bulk density $\rho_b$, surface density of the
mass load $\mathcal{S}_n$, and surface pressure $\mathcal{Q_n}$. In
principle, we can account for the stacking of different layers with
there own Lovenumbers by manipulating this expression. For example,
Farhat et al. (2025) provides the forms for $U_n^L$ for a magma ocean
and $\mathcal{Q_n}$ for a uniform lithosphere/crust for the Andrade
rheology. M. Beuthe (2016) provides its explicit form for a crust
characterized by a Maxwell rheology, allowing for radial variations in
the physical properties. I don't know the exact form we should use for
atmospheric pressure, but it can probably be found. Nevertheless, we
should note that each of these terms is effectively just a correction to
the global Lovenumber (and as shown by Farhat et al., 2025 for the
crust, often has only a small effect). As such, we may consider
implementing these corrections in the future, but they should not alter
the results drastically. Given this, we currently combine the
Lovenumbers of the solid and fluid using the simple form

$$k_n = k^T_n + (1 + k^L_n) k_n^{T, \text{(fluid)}}$$ 

to get the global
Lovenumber $k_n$. For this, the determination of tidal and load
lovenumber $k_n$ has been implemented in Obliqua. The other terms are
currently set to zero, but can easily also be determined, allowing us to
further expand on this in the future. Finally, note that the loading
Lovenumbers (both gravity and pressure) are only defined for the solid
part of the mantle.

Evidently, these $y$-functions are functions of radius, hence we wrote
$\pmb{y_{n,m}}(r)$ before. They are effectively the solutions at each
radii to the following first order differential equation

$$\frac{d\pmb{y}_{n,m}(r)}{dr} = \pmb{A}_n (r) \pmb{y}_{n,m}(r) - \pmb{f}_{n,m}(r)$$

where $\pmb{A}_n$ represents the motion matrix with unit $\sim1/r$, it
is a differential operator. The correction term $\pmb{f}_{n,m}(r)$
represents sources and sinks that may be present within the interior
(e.g. earthquakes, actually we will use it for porous interfaces!).

In principle $\pmb{A}_n$ can be anything you want, as long as it
represents the medium that you are considering. There are many different
motion matrices in the literature, but for our purposes one is of
specific interest 

$$\small
\pmb{A}_n(r) = \\
\begin{pmatrix}
-\dfrac{2\lambda}{r\beta} & \dfrac{\ell(\ell+1)\lambda}{r\beta} & \dfrac{1}{\beta} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\[1.2em]

-\dfrac{1}{r} & \dfrac{1}{r} & 0 & \frac{1}{\mu} & 0 & 0 \\[1.2em]

\dfrac{4}{r}\!\left( \dfrac{3\kappa\mu}{r\beta} - \rho_{0}g \right) { - \rho_0 \omega^2} &
\dfrac{\ell(\ell+1)}{r}\!\left(\rho_{0}g - \dfrac{6\kappa\mu}{r\beta}\right) &
-\dfrac{4\mu}{r\beta} & \dfrac{\ell(\ell+1)}{r} & \dfrac{\rho_{0}(\ell+1)}{r} &
-\rho_{0} \\[1.2em]
\dfrac{1}{r}\!\left(\rho_{0}g - \dfrac{6\mu\kappa}{r\beta}\right) &
\dfrac{2\mu}{r^{2}}\!\left[\ell(\ell+1)\!\left(1+\dfrac{\lambda}{\beta}\right)-1\right] { - \rho_0 \omega^2} &
-\dfrac{\lambda}{r\beta} & - \dfrac{3}{r} &
-\dfrac{\rho_{0}}{r} & 0 \\[1.2em] 
4\pi G \rho_{0} & 0 & 0 & 0 & -\dfrac{\ell+1}{r} & 1 \\[1.2em]
\dfrac{4\pi G \rho_{0} (\ell+1)}{r} & -\dfrac{4\pi G \rho_{0} \ell(\ell+1)}{r} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dfrac{\ell-1}{r} 
\end{pmatrix}$$ 

with ($\ell = n$, same thing, different notation) and

$$\beta = \lambda + 2 \mu$$

and $\lambda$ is the second Lamé parameter
that is expressed in terms of the shear modulus $\mu$ (also known as
first Lamé parameter) and the bulk modulus $\kappa$

$$\lambda = \kappa - \frac{2}{3}\mu.$$

As you can see, this matrix has size $6\times 6$, implying that it
couples six $y$-functions. Specifically these are
$U_{n,m} , V_{n,m} , X_{n,m} , Y_{n,m}, \Phi_{n,m} , \Psi_{n,m}$. We may
extend the motion matrix to also include corrections from porosity, the
corresponding a matrix will have size $8\times 8$. A dot ($\cdot$) marks
an entry that is carried over unchanged from the $6\times 6$ matrix
above (whether or not that entry happens to be zero); an explicit "$0$"
means the entry is genuinely zero, or genuinely new and zero, in the
poro-elastic system.

where 

$$\beta^{-1} = \frac{1}{2\mu + \lambda}, \quad 
S = \frac{\phi}{K_\ell} + \frac{\alpha - \phi}{K}, \quad 
\lambda = K_d - \frac{2\mu}{3}.$$

The terms involving $k$, $\eta_\ell$,
and $\omega$ represent viscous coupling between the solid and liquid
phases, while the terms with $G$ describe self-gravitational feedback.
When $\phi = 0$, the system reduces to the single-phase viscoelastic
formulation.

It is important to note that the ordering of the elements in
$\pmb{A}_n(r)$ and $\pmb{y}_{n,m}(r)$ must be consistent. Different
papers will order the $y$-functions differently (specifically $y_2$ and
$y_3$ are often flipped). For the shooting-method solvers (`solid1d`,
`solid1d-mush`) the standard ordering above is used directly, with no
benefit to reordering. The relaxation-method solvers do perform the
$[\text{lower}, \text{upper}]^T$ reorganization described here: this is
exactly the `Y6 = [1,2,4,5,3,6]` and `Y8 = [1,2,5,6,3,7,4,8]` ordering
used in `src/solid1d_mush_relax.jl` to embed the $6\times6$ elastic
system as a view into the $8\times8$ poro-elastic one — see
[Solid-Phase - solid1d-mush-relax](@ref).

This puts us in a bit of an awkward spot, since we have a coupled system
of ODEs, but we can only constrain half of the $y$-functions at the
surface. The missing piece is the core solution vector! Interestingly,
we can determine also tides acting within the core if we really want to,
since it would merely require another $\pmb{A}_n(r)$ for that regime. We
can then simply impose a constraint on the lower $y$-functions at the
center of the planet leaving us with six unknowns and six knows, solving
the system. There is a catch, as this particular approach has a
singularity at $r=0$. One can potentially omit this by starting the
solution at some $\delta r > 0$, but this still leaves us with a core
that has no radially resolved structure. Instead we can make use of the
analytically derived solutions for a homogeneous core! The solutions
place constraints on all six $y$-functions at the Core-Mantle Boundary,
hence over constraining the system. To combat this, we now have three
solution vectors (instead of just 1) at the CMB. These solution vectors
are so-called elementary solutions ($\mathbf{y}^{(i)}, i = 1,2,3$) of an
isotropic homogeneous elastic-gravitational sphere. The true solution is
naturally some weighted average of the three solutions, hence
introducing three new unknowns: we are saved the system is no longer
overestimated!

Let us define $\pmb{C}$ the vector of constants of integration (weights)

$$\pmb{C} = (a_1, a_2, a_3),$$

these constants of integration must be
determined using the boundary condition at the Earth's surface for the
stress components of the spheroidal vector solution. The (true) modal
solution vector can be written as a superposition of the elementary
solutions $y^{(i)}$ which are regular at the centre of the body,

$$\pmb{y}_n(r_C^+) = a_1 \mathbf{y}^{(1)} + a_2 \mathbf{y}^{(2)} + a_3 \mathbf{y}^{(3)},$$

implying that as our true solution $\pmb{y}_n(r_C^+)$ approaches the
core from above ($r_C^+$) it must smoothly (for mathematicians:
smoothness class $C^0$; continuous) transition into the core solution
vector (which is then the weighted superposition of the elementary
solutions). So just to be clear, the core also only has one solution,
but it can be expressed as three elementary solutions. The moment we fix
$\pmb{C}$ we implicitly fix also the core solution!

We can now introduce the exact elementary solutions at the CMB.
Equations (95) for toroidal modes and (98) and (100) for spheroidal
modes of Takeuchi & Saito (1972) are adopted for the inner boundary
conditions. We express the spheroidal vector solution at the bottom of
the solid mantle as 

$$\pmb{y}_n(r_C^+) = \pmb{I}_C \pmb{C}$$

where
$\pmb{I}_C$ is the core-mantle boundary (CMB) matrix for a fluid core
(quantities correspond to core density/radius/surface gravity!) 

$$\small
\pmb{I}_C = \\
\begin{pmatrix}
-r^n/g & 0 & 1 \\[1.2em]
0 & 1 & 0 \\[1.2em]
0 & 0 & g \rho \\[1.2em]
0 & 0 & 0 \\[1.2em]
-r^n & 0 & 0 \\[1.2em]
-2(n-1)r^{(n-1)} & 0 & -4 \pi G \rho
\end{pmatrix}$$ 

The three columns correspond to the elementary
solutions. Similar to how we were able to define different
$\pmb{A}_l(r)$, we may also impose different effects on our core,
yielding different elementary solutions. Specifically, we may impose
that the core is a incompressible solid, or that it is a rotating fluid
core, taking into account inertia effects at high forcing frequencies.
For now, this simple and elegant solution will suffice, though the
inclusion of inertia effects will be essential for the Earth-Moon
system, this does not change the method so we can proceed like this for
now.

#### The four `core` options

The `[orbit.obliqua.solid].core` option selects which $\pmb{I}_C$ is used. There
are two static (frequency-independent) limits and two dynamic
(frequency-dependent, $\omega \neq 0$) generalizations of them:

* **`"liquid"`**: the static ($\omega = 0$) fluid core matrix $\pmb{I}_C$ given
  above (Takeuchi & Saito 1972). Two columns carry the physical degrees of
  freedom; the third is a pure tangential-slip vector ($y_2 = 1$, else $0$),
  representing the discontinuity in horizontal displacement that a fluid core
  permits at the fluid-solid interface.
* **`"solid"`**: the static, incompressible, elastic solid core of Love
  (1911). All three columns are genuine elementary solutions, regular at
  $r=0$; the incompressible limit ($K \to \infty$) means $K$ does not enter
  the formula. There is no fluid-solid interface, so no column is a slip
  vector.
* **`"inertial-liquid"`**: the general, oscillating ($\omega \neq 0$),
  compressible fluid ($\mu = 0$) core (Takeuchi & Saito 1972; Korenaga 2025).
  This is the case derived below. It reduces to `"liquid"` as $\omega \to 0$:
  a slowly oscillating fluid approaches hydrostatic equilibrium.
* **`"inertial"`**: the general, oscillating, compressible, finite-$\mu,K$
  solid core (Takeuchi & Saito 1972; Kervazo et al. 2021). It reduces to
  `"inertial-liquid"` as $\mu \to 0$ (an oscillating solid without shear
  rigidity is an oscillating fluid), and to `"solid"` as $\omega \to 0$ and
  $K \to \infty$ (the static, incompressible limit of the general oscillating
  solid recovers the classical elastic solution). All three columns are
  again genuine elementary solutions with no slip vector.

Use `"solid"`/`"liquid"` for the static limit, and
`"inertial"`/`"inertial-liquid"` when frequency-dependent (dynamic) effects
at the core boundary matter. The full matrix entries for `"solid"` and
`"inertial"` are implemented in `get_Ic` (`src/common.jl`) and are not
reproduced here; the derivation below covers the `"inertial-liquid"` case in
detail, since it is algebraically the most tractable of the two dynamic
options.

### Nullspace vs. direct use: shooting vs. relaxation

The shooting- and relaxation-method solvers use $\pmb{I}_C$ in two
different ways, and it is worth being explicit about the distinction
since it is easy to conflate them.

* **Shooting method** (`solid1d`, `solid1d-mush`): the three columns of
  $\pmb{I}_C$ are used *directly* as the three starting vectors for the
  numerical integration, $\pmb{y}^{(i)}(r_C^+) = \pmb{I}_C \pmb{e}_i$.
  Since $\pmb{I}_C$ is constructed to already be regular at $r=0$ and
  satisfy the core physics by definition, the CMB boundary condition is
  automatically satisfied by construction — there is nothing further to
  solve for at the core; only the weights $\pmb{C}$ are later fixed by
  the surface condition.
* **Relaxation method** (`solid1d-relax`, `solid1d-mush-relax`,
  `solid1d-equil-relax`): here the solver never propagates elementary
  solutions — it solves for the full state vector $\pmb{y}_n(r)$ directly
  at every grid point simultaneously, so the CMB condition must instead
  be expressed as a *linear constraint* $\pmb{B}_1 \pmb{y}(r_C^+) = 0$
  that any admissible solution vector satisfies. This $\pmb{B}_1$ is
  obtained numerically as the left nullspace of $\pmb{I}_C$ (`get_core_bc!`
  in `src/common.jl`: `nullspace(transpose(Ic))`), i.e. the row vectors
  orthogonal to every column of $\pmb{I}_C$. Since $\pmb{I}_C$'s three
  columns span the admissible 3-dimensional subspace of the 6-dimensional
  state space at the CMB, this 3-dimensional orthogonal complement is
  exactly equivalent to using $\pmb{I}_C$ as starting vectors — it is the
  same boundary condition, just expressed as a constraint rather than a
  basis, because the relaxation method never explicitly constructs
  $\pmb{C}$.

The `"inertial-liquid"` and `"inertial"` core options are implemented
exactly this way in `get_Ic` (Takeuchi & Saito 1972; Korenaga 2025;
Kervazo et al. 2021 — see the citations above), using the full,
frequency-dependent Bessel-function solution rather than any low-frequency
approximation. In the low-forcing-frequency limit relevant to most solid
cores ($k^2 \ll -1$, i.e. roughly $\omega \ll 10^{-3}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ for
Earth's core), that general solution admits a considerably simpler,
purely algebraic closed form (no Bessel functions or their recursion
relations required):

$$\begin{aligned}
    \bar{y}_1 (r) &= -r^{n+1} [f z_n(x) - nh] \\
    \bar{y}_2 (r) &= -r^{n+1} [-z_n(x) - h] \\
    \bar{y}_3 (r) &= -\lambda f r^n x^2 \\
    \bar{y}_4 (r) &= 0 \\
    \bar{y}_5 (r) &= -3\gamma f r^{n+2} \\
    \bar{y}_6 (r) &= -3\gamma [(2n+1)f - nh] r^{n+1}
\end{aligned}$$

with $\gamma = 4\pi G\rho/3$, $f = -\omega^2/\gamma$, $h = f-(n+1)$, and
$z_n(x)$ the Bessel ratio $x\,j_{n+1}(x)/j_n(x)$. This low-frequency
simplification is **not currently implemented** — `get_Ic` always
evaluates the general form — and is left as a possible future
optimization rather than derived in full here.

Finally, we should note that the porosity related $y$-functions need
also be bounded from below and partially from above. Moreover, since a
porous layer is likely to form at some point midway through the mantle,
and not just at the CMB, we will need to account for these boundary
conditions in a slightly different way. Think of the lower boundary as
an extension to the already existing elementary solutions, instead of
three there are now four such elementary solutions. As long as you know
the current form (at some radius) of the three elementary solutions, you
can simply add one more, then forward propagate the four solutions to
the surface (or where ever the porous layer ends) and apply the boundary
conditions directly to obtain the weights
$\pmb{C} = (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$. This is basically the approach taken
in the so-called "shooting method". However, as we will see, this
becomes more difficult once we move to solution/transfer space where we
do not have direct access to the current form of the three elementary
solutions, but rather only know how the solution vector $\pmb{y}_n(r)$
(this can be any solution vector, not just the true solution) transforms
between layers. This is a central aspect of the "relaxation method" (or
Henyey style solver) that we will employ as it is substantially more
stable then the shooting method.

For now we will finish this section by stating the elementary boundary
conditions to be imposed on the poro-viscoelastic solution vector. At
the lower boundary of the porous layer the pore pressure is nonzero
$b_{(7,4)} = 1$ and we have zero radial Darcy flux $b_{(8,4)} = 0$. At
the upper part of the porous layer we impose again zero radial Darcy
flux $b_{(8)} = 0$, without any constraint on the pore pressure.

We will now discuss the different solver schemes.
