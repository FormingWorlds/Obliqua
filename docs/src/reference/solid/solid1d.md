# Solid-Phase - solid1d

The `solid1d` model uses the shooting method approach and is in many regards identical to the original **Lovepy** model (now called **Love.jl**) by Hamish Hay (see [original repository](https://github.com/hamishHay/Love.jl)). 

The structure of the model is as follows: 
1. We impose the Core-Mantle Boundary (CMB) condition (three elementary solutions). 
2. We solve the system at each radius:
   $$\frac{d\pmb{y}_{n,m}(r)}{dr} = \pmb{A}_n (r) \pmb{y}_{n,m}(r) - \pmb{f}_{n,m}(r)$$
   stepping (shooting) from the CMB to the surface. 

For this model, we assume $\pmb{f}_{n,m}(r) = \pmb{0}$, as porosity effects are not included. 

### The Propagator Matrix
A convenient way to treat the state vectors $\pmb{y}_{n,m}(r)$ is to define the propagator matrix $\pmb\Pi_n(r)$ (a $6 \times 6$ matrix) that takes the state vector at $r_i$ to $r_{i+1}$:

$$\pmb{y}_{n,m}(r_{i+1}) = \pmb\Pi_n(r_{i}) \pmb{y}_{n,m}(r_{i})$$

Using the **RK4 (Runge-Kutta 4th Order)** method, we have:

$$\pmb\Pi_n(r_{i}) = \pmb{1} + \frac{1}{6} \left(\pmb{K}_1 + \pmb{K}_2 + \pmb{K}_3 + \pmb{K}_4 \right)$$

where:
$$\begin{aligned}
    \pmb{K}_1 &= \Delta r_i \pmb{A}_n (r_i) \\
    \pmb{K}_2 &= \Delta r_i \pmb{A}_n (r_i + \Delta r_i / 2) \left[ \pmb{1} + \frac{1}{2} \pmb{K}_1 \right] \\
    \pmb{K}_3 &= \Delta r_i \pmb{A}_n (r_i + \Delta r_i / 2) \left[ \pmb{1} + \frac{1}{2} \pmb{K}_2 \right] \\
    \pmb{K}_4 &= \Delta r_i \pmb{A}_n (r_i + \Delta r_i) \left[ \pmb{1} +  \pmb{K}_3 \right] 
\end{aligned}$$

### Shooting vs. Relaxation
It is worth highlighting that this method purely propagates the solution vectors to the surface. Effectively, we attempt to solve the two-point **Boundary Value Problem (BVP)** by rewriting it as an initial value problem and imposing a constraint at the end. 

*   **Shooting Method:** The propagator matrix $\pmb\Pi_n(r)$ has no knowledge of the surface boundary until it arrives there, which means it may diverge before the boundary conditions can be applied. 
*   **Relaxation Method:** Solves the state vectors globally based on both boundary conditions simultaneously, making it significantly more stable.

### Numerical Integration
Imposing continuity of the propagator (implying the solution itself is continuous):
$$\pmb \Pi_n (r_i^+,r') = \pmb \Pi_n (r_i^-,r')$$

And imposing CMB conditions in the general solution:
$$\pmb y_{n,m}(r_C^+) = \pmb y_0 = \pmb I_C \pmb C$$

We find:
$$\pmb y_{n,m}(r) = \pmb \Pi_n (r,r_C^+) \pmb I_C \pmb C$$

We iterate through the mantle, repeatedly multiplying the elementary solutions with the propagator matrix until we reach the surface ($R = a^-$).

### Surface Boundary Conditions
At the surface, we impose the boundary conditions on the upper components of the $y$-functions using a projector $\pmb P_1$:

$$\pmb P_1 \pmb y (a^-) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
y_3(a^-) \\[1.2em]
y_4(a^-) \\[1.2em]
\frac{n+1}{a^-} y_5(a^-) + y_6(a^-)
\end{pmatrix} = 
\pmb P_1 \left( \pmb\Pi_n (a^-, r_C^+) \pmb I_C \pmb C \right) = \pmb b$$

where $\pmb b$ is the 3-vector composed of the RHS of the surface boundary conditions. This allows for the determination of the coefficient vector $\pmb C$, which is used to combine the three elementary solutions into the true modal solution.
