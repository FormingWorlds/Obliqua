## Coding style
- Indentation uses 4 spaces, no tabs.
- Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores .
- Lines should aim to have a length of no more than 92 characters.
- All functions should have docstrings, ideally with Arguments and Returns listed.
- More comments are always better, even if they seem redundant.
- Use type hinting where possible.
- Print statements should be made through the logger where possible.
