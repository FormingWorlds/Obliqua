### Main loop

Now that the user is able to interface with Obliqua, we will shift our
focus to the inner workings of the main function. Before starting the
main iteration, Obliqua checks if all required configuration parameters
are specified. Subsequently, it loads the configuration into the
variables used by the code. Some configuration parameters may be set to
"none", the function `nothing_if_none` converts these strings to nothing
type elements in Julia. The interior arrays are then converted to
Bigfloat, this helps stabilize the solver and allows it to cover even
large discontinuities.

# Segments

The interior is subdivided into so-called "segments". These segments are
identified based on their local viscosity, any segment below the
liquidus viscosity is liquid, and above the solidus is solid. In between
these the formalism employed is mush. Notably, the advised choice it
setting the solidus viscosity to $\sim 10^{5}$ Pa s, allowing for
solid-like viscous dissipation and compaction to characterize the
dissipation in the mush. Only at very low viscosities does one expect
fluid waves, as such the liquidus may be set to as low as $\sim 10^2$ Pa
s. To bridge the region between these models one can either further
extend the solid formalism, or use the "interp" model in the mush,
allowing for a more smooth transition in the heating profile.

# Core

The code assumes a uniform core. The effects on the local gravity are
calculated and the density for the fluid density contrast are set.

# $k$-range

The tidal potential can be expanded in an infinite sum of spherical
harmonic terms with some degree $n$, order $m$, and harmonic $k$
(integer values). The user has the option the provide these quantities
in the configuration. However, specifically the $k$-range may also be
determined by the code. The desired range increases with eccentricity,
for our purposes the desired range $K$ contains

```math
\{k \in K \, \forall \, k : X^{-(n+1), m}_k \geq 0.01\ | k \in Z\}
```

where $X^{-(n+1), m}_k$ is the Hansen coefficient. Basically, we only
include $k$ in the range $K$ if the corresponding Hansen coefficient
signifies a contribution greater than 1% to the complete tidal response.
One may specify a different criterion and generate their $K$ using the
included Notebook on the Obliqua Github repository
"/examples/hansen_k_table.ipynb".

For testing convenience Obliqua includes two modes: "full" and
"adaptive". In principle, one should use "full" to test the tidal
calculation over a large range of forcing frequencies, and use
"adaptive" when using Obliqua with a PROTEUS-like framework. The former
will determine the planet response to all relevant forcing frequencies
and assumes $k = 1$ for every forcing frequency, while the latter only
calculates the response at the exact forcing frequencies excited by the
specific orbital configuration using $K$.

# Forcing frequency

The forcing frequencies $\sigma$ are simply obtained for every order $m$
and harmonic $k$ as 

```math
\sigma = m \Omega - k \omega.
```

# Complex shear modulus

The frequency response of the mantle is computed assuming a homogeneous
viscoelastic mantle. Obliqua implements two rheological models: Maxwell
and Andrade. Unlike the Maxwell model, which captures only
elastic--viscous behavior through a single Maxwell timescale, the
Andrade rheology includes a transient anelastic component. This yields
an elastic response at high forcing frequencies, a viscous response at
low frequencies governed by the Maxwell timescale $\tau_M = \eta / \mu$,
and a smooth anelastic transition in between characterized by the
Andrade timescale $\tau_A$ and creep exponent $\alpha$. As a result, the
Andrade rheology reproduces the observed attenuation behavior of
planetary mantles more accurately, particularly at high tidal forcing
frequencies. The rheologies are incorporated via their definitions of
the complex shear modulus. For the Andrade rheology, the complex shear
modulus is

```math
\tilde{\mu}(\sigma) =
\frac{\mu}{
1 + (\mathrm{i}\sigma\eta/\mu)^{-\alpha}\Gamma(1+\alpha)
  + (\mathrm{i}\sigma\eta/\mu)^{-1}}, \qquad \alpha = 0.3,
```

where $\mu$ is the elastic shear modulus and $\Gamma$ the Gamma
function.

For the Maxwell limit $\alpha = 0$ and

```math 
\tilde{\mu}(\sigma) =
\frac{\mu}{1 + (\mathrm{i}\sigma\eta/\mu)^{-1}}.
```
