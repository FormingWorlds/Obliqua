## Julia version is incompatible / Errors about OpenSSL library
You must use Julia version 1.11 because there are incompatibilities between the OpenSSL library required by Julia1.12 and Python. 

Switch Julia versions using the `juliaup` command. E.g:
```bash
juliaup status        # Show the versions you have installed
juliaup add 1.11      # Install Julia 1.11
juliaup default 1.11  # Make 1.11 your default version of Julia
julia --version       # This should say 1.11.*
```

After following these steps, try installing Obliqua again.

## Julia errors on start, potentially referencing the CURL library
It is important that the shell environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is
not set when running Obliqua. This will cause Julia to use the wrong libraries, which will causes problems. You can unset this variable or reset using either of the following commands
```bash
unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=""
```
If this does not help, it's possible that you are using a Julia distribution provided by your system package manager. It's important that you only use Julia distributed from the official website.
